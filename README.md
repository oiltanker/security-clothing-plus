# Description

The mod that makes security clothing work more like medic's clothing by creating 2 ammo slots and an additional holster slot for weapons *(with proper visuals with client-side lua)*.

The holster slot can contain any weapon but only ***'big guns'** (e.g. Autoshotgun, Assault Rifle and Grenade Launcher)* will get holster animations.

Additional features *(unlocked by installing [client-side lua](#Client-side-lua-installation), see below)* include hot-swapping the guns in and out of the holster slot by pressing 'toggle inventory' button *(most commonly **`Q`**)*.

# Client-side lua installation

* Install **[Lua For Barotrauma](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2559634234)** mod
* In the setting menu select **LuaForBarotrauma** as the content package, on top of the mod menu.
* Host in-game server ***twice\*** (it will give the error the first time)*
* While in the hosting menu open the console window *(most commonly **`F3`**)*
* Type in or copy, then execute the console command: `install_cl_lua`
* Restart the game
